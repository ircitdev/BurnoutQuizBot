## Quiz Questions

### Question 1/10

**Many people think rest is simply 'doing nothing.' But Burnout Bootcamp takes a different approach. What is the recovery program based on?**

| Answer | Correct | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Neuroscience and research | ✅ | Correct! The program is developed by scientists and is based on the biology of stress. |
| Esoterics and magic | ❌ | No, the organizers emphasize that this is a science-based approach. |
| Intense sports | ❌ | The program's foundation is working with the nervous system, not exhaustion. |
| Calligraphy | ❌ | That's an interesting experience, but the program focuses on leader recovery. |

### Question 2/10

**Mornings in the Kochi mountains don't start with checking emails. What procedure kicks off the day to 'reboot' the nervous system?**

| Answer | Correct | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| A 10 km marathon | ❌ | That would be too much stress for the body. |
| Cold water immersion | ✅ | Exactly! Cold water and grounding invigorate the body and prepare the mind. |
| An economics lecture | ❌ | Mornings are dedicated to the body and senses, not numbers. |
| Coffee in bed | ❌ | A real neuro-reboot requires more active methods. |

### Question 3/10

**What unique activity will participants do on Awaji Island to assess their condition?**

| Answer | Correct | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Build a raft | ❌ | The program is focused on inner work, not survival. |
| Search for treasure | ❌ | The real treasure is understanding yourself. |
| Resilience Wheel assessment | ✅ | Spot on! It's a deep evaluation of the participant's current resilience. |
| A day of silence | ❌ | Silence is part of the experience, but the key activity is the resilience assessment. |

### Question 4/10

**How are evenings spent to activate the parasympathetic system ('rest mode')?**

| Answer | Correct | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Onsen baths and stargazing | ✅ | Hot water and the night sky are the best ways to tell your body to relax. |
| Karaoke parties | ❌ | That stimulates the nervous system, but the goal is calming down. |
| Writing business plans | ❌ | Working in the evenings is forbidden! It's time to rest. |
| Horror movies | ❌ | Participants already have enough stress in their daily lives. |

### Question 5/10

**What valuable thing will each participant take home besides souvenirs?**

| Answer | Correct | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| A survival certificate | ❌ | This is not just an adventure, but serious self-improvement work. |
| A knife set | ❌ | The main value of the tour is tools for the mind. |
| A photo with the emperor | ❌ | Meeting the emperor is not part of the program. |
| A resilience roadmap | ✅ | Correct. It's a plan that will help maintain effectiveness for an entire year. |

### Question 6/10

**Where does most of the program take place for maximum seclusion?**

| Answer | Correct | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Downtown Tokyo | ❌ | Tokyo is too noisy. We're heading to tranquility. |
| Quieter Japan | ✅ | Yes, it's the 'Quieter Japan' concept — far from the noise of megacities. |
| Disneyland | ❌ | It's fun there, but restoring your nervous system would be difficult. |
| On a bullet train | ❌ | The retreat base consists of peaceful mountain lodges. |

### Question 7/10

**Why is the group strictly limited (up to 12 people)?**

| Answer | Correct | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| For trust and intimacy | ✅ | Working on burnout requires safety, which is impossible in a crowd. |
| Not enough beds | ❌ | It's about the quality of group dynamics. |
| Zodiac signs | ❌ | No mysticism. Only psychology. |
| Quick control | ❌ | The main reason is psychological comfort. |

### Question 8/10

**What practice is planned at the Nikobuchi waterfall?**

| Answer | Correct | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Jumping into water | ❌ | That's dangerous and doesn't reduce stress. |
| Digital detox | ✅ | Yes! Disconnecting from gadgets allows the brain to switch modes. |
| Photo shoot | ❌ | The goal is to put down the phone and be in the moment. |
| Bare-hand fishing | ❌ | The program focuses on contemplation. |

### Question 9/10

| Answer | Correct | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Professional guide | ❌ | Her expertise is the science of stress. |
| Chef | ❌ | Aksinya is responsible for 'food for thought.' |

| Body connection and freedom | ✅ | Yes. Deep self-understanding leads to this state. |
